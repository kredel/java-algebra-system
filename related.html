<h2>Computer Algebra Systems using Java</h2>

<ul>
<li><p> 
    <a href="https://github.com/rjolly/scas" target="scas">ScAS</a> is
    a computer algebra system developed in Scala. Scala has some more
    features than Java to optimally support the implementation of a
    computer algebra system. The basic structure of ScAS is developed
    in cooperation with the basic structure of JAS, see the
    co-authored papers in the <a href="intro.html#docu"
    target="main">Documentation</a> section. ScAS is also a successor
    of jscl-meditor.

    <a href="http://jscl-meditor.sourceforge.net/" target="rela">jscl-meditor</a>
    Java symbolic computing library and mathematical editor.
    The goal of this project is to provide a Java symbolic computing library 
    and a mathematical editor acting as a front-end to the former. 
    There are several computer algebra systems available on the market, 
    most of them developed in other languages, mainly C/C++ and Lisp. 
    But the benefits of using Java in symbolic computation are great. 
    Aside from being widely used and to comply with various standards, 
    this language has two features of concern: readability and portability.

    <a href="http://www.matheclipse.org" target="rela">MathEclipse</a>
    is a Java Computer Algebra system. MathEclipse has functions for 
    arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, matrices, vectors, finite sets, 
    derivatives, pattern-matching rewriting rules and functional programming.

    Features: arbitrary precision integers, rationals and complex numbers, 
    polynomials, differentiation, pattern matching and linear algebra.

    <a href="http://www.geogebra.org" target="rela">GeoGebra</a>
    is dynamic mathematics software for all levels of education that joins
    arithmetic, geometry, algebra and calculus. On the one hand, GeoGebra
    is an interactive geometry system. You can do constructions with
    points, vectors, segments, lines, conic sections as well as functions
    and change them dynamically afterwards. On the other hand, equations
    and coordinates can be entered directly. Thus, GeoGebra has the
    ability to deal with variables for numbers, vectors and points, finds
    derivatives and integrals of functions and offers commands like Root
    or Extremum. These two views are characteristic of GeoGebra: an
    expression in the algebra view corresponds to an object in the
    graphics view and vice versa.

    enough to be learned as a first programming language and yet powerful
    enough to be useful in any science, mathematics, or engineering
    related career.  MathPiper is also a Computer Algebra System (CAS)
    which is similar in function to the CAS which is included in the TI 89
    and TI 92 calculators.

    Java Geometry Expert is an ongoing developing system which initially began in 
    early 2004 in Wichita State Univerisity. JGEX is a system which combines 
    our approach for visually dynamic presentation of proofs (VDDP), 
    dynamic geometry software (DGS), automated geometry theorem prover (GTP).
    The VDDP part is the most distinctive part of JGEX. It is based on our work 
    on DGS and GTP. JGEX can be used to create proofs either manually and automatically. 
    It provides a seris of visual effects for presenting of these proofs. 
    With the applet version of JGEX, the user may create beautiful examples 
    and put them on the web to share with others
